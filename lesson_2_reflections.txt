What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A:  Git creates a .git repository folder to keep version tracking information in.  Without this there will be no version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: staging area is where you make your changes?  then when you are done you commit. git manages this behind the scenes

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A: anywhere that a logical split would happen such as an easy mode for a game or a different language or an experimental portion of the code.  this way you can focus on only one branch at a time without messing up everything else.
